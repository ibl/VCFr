VCFr 
====

HTTP REST semantically interoperable web service resource to traverse [Variant Call Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format) files.


This repository was set to host upcoming work, contingent on funding, on the development of [web computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_computing) resources to link, index and serve the genomic results described in VCF files, and expose them through a simple API. For ongoing exploratory work leading to this project see https://github.com/ibl/vcf.
